atom is good
and github is good
all will be record if i can push the information to github

here it teaches
i got a github account
i create a repository

i have 2 computer
computer A at home
computer B at work
how to keep the 2 computer in sync
meaning i have to create another atom in the lenovo s30 - 32gb

github
better solution
git and github is tracking all the changes
they going to keep everything in sync AUTOMATICALLY
but if there is a conflict
example, changing on the same line,
git and github will ASK YOU TO RESOLVE THE conflict
